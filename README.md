## 👩‍💻 How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Mongoose Atlas

FrontEnd - Used React to help create the UI components

BackEnd - Used Mongoose Atlas for the backend database


## 🏸 Optimizations

Things I would like to fix/add
- show the amount required to order from the supplier
- show batches to make
- have input to change the serving size
- show the converted recipe
- add machine learning given sample data - to guess how much to make for the week



## 📝 Lessons Learned:

Currently working on


## 👩‍💻 To try the project
